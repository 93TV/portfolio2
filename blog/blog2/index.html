        <h1>Gratitude</h1>
        <p class="postdate">14.01.23</p>
        <p>Although crisis might be upon us and a lot of dark energy is starting to get noticeable , it is time to look at the bright
            side, ying-yang is always present, so let's stop focussing on the negative and start focussing on the
            positive. I'm grateful to live in this golden age full of possibilities.
        </p>
        <p> New and old media have always been great at spotlighting wat is going wrong in the world, giving us all this
            major sense of failing and responsibilities. But, there so much more than that, it is about time we take our moment
            to look at all which is going good, all which is evolving in the right direction. I believe we are entering a
            new awakening, and not only mentally but also spiritually. Look at all the possibilities and opportunities
            we are presented with as humankind. Sometimes we forget what good things we do, and how far we've come.
        </p>
        <p>It's time to focus on those things that work, the things that are sustainable and promote love. Because love
        is the power and the power is love.</p>
