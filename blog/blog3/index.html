        <h1>Knowledge</h1>
        <p class="postdate">15.01.23</p>
        <p>As a teenager I wasn't aware of the impact and possibilities a school can offer. I used to have this
            rebellious feeling towards it, but now I'm experiencing an abundance of intellect and have the urge
            to dive deep into it. School is a place full of wonder, experiment and growth, excited to learn more!
        </p>
        <p>Now I look at it like I'm a wizard at Hogwarts, help will given to them who ask for it, and it's true,the more
            you ask, the more problems you try to solve, the more you fail, the more intellect and experience you're gaining.
            Sometimes we forget that the process is the reward, the steep hill climb, the morning run, but also expanding your brain,
            doing stuff outside your comfort zone, al these processes we go trough, are the reward themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's stop chasing the reward and start focussing on the proces itself, which in essence is the reward itself.
            You'll notice that you'll love the processes more, and get more joy out of them. Any process in any field. I found this
            in knowledge and studying and love to immerse myself in problems, quests and puzzles to tingle my brain, go through the process,
            and evolve with a smile!
