        <h1>Knowledge</h1>
        <p class="postdate">15.01.23</p>
        <p>As a teenager I wasn't aware of the impact and possibilities a school can offer. I used to have this
            rebellious feeling towards it, but now I'm experiencing the abundance of intellect a school has to offer
            and I feel the urge to dive deep into it. School is a place full of wonder, experiment and growth, excited
            to learn more!
        </p>
        <p>Now I look at it like I'm a wizard at Hogwarts, help will be given to them who ask for it, and it's true,the
            more
            you ask, the more problems you try to solve, the more you fail, the more intellect and experience you're
            gaining.
            Sometimes we forget that the process is the reward, the steep hill climb, the morning run, but also
            expanding your brain,
            doing stuff outside your comfort zone, al these processes we go through, are the reward themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's stop chasing the reward and start focussing on the process itself, which in essence is the reward
            itself.
            You'll notice that you'll love the processes more, and get more joy out of it. Any process in any field. I
            found this
            in knowledge and studying, I love to immerse myself in problems, quests and puzzles to tingle my brain, go
            through the process,
            and evolve with a smile! I hope you do to!
        </p>
