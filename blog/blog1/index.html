        <h1>A New Chapter!</h1>
        <p class="postdate">07.01.23</p>
        <p>Let's start by introducing myself. I am Thibault, 29 years old and living in Ghent, Belgium. For the past
            five years I have worked in the music industry, where I have had tons of fun. But since 2021, I have heard
            my inner nerd screaming for attention and decided to choose a different path. So here I am, at the beginning
            of a new chapter.
        </p>
        <p>I am not sure what makes new chapters so exciting for me, but I am really fond of big changes in life. Even
            though they scare the hell out of me, I am never able to root myself in a certain situation or location for
            too long. It is like having this constant urge to create new experiences and learn new stuff. In my case, I
            started embracing my inner nerd, and I haven't felt such an excitement in a very long time.
            Looking back, I really needed to take a step aside from the rock 'n' roll life-style and get back in touch
            with myself. While figuring out the reason of sudden change â€“ which was taking some time, I went through
            some dark days, having no idea what to do when I was quitting my job and my - back then, current way of
            living. I ended up here, at the Odisee Technology Campus where I'm currently studying programming,
            electronics and web-development.

        </p>
        <p>I encourage all of you who are on the verge of jumping into the unknown to actually take the jump, take all
            the chances you got and keep following that gut feel, that first feeling that tells you what to do before
            the thought process begins. If I can change this much, all of you can!</p>
